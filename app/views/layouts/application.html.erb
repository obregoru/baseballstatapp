<h1>Test Driven Development Example</h1>
<b>This app is <i>only</i> intended to show the results of TDD techniques .</b>

<p>It's not intended to showcase the user interface, security, jQuery, JavaScript or CSS. </p>

<h2>Test First, Code Later</h2>

<p>The purpose of the site is to demonstrate my TDD skills - this site was developed using the "test first, code later" concept.<p>
	
<h2>Legacy Code</h2>

<p>I could have developed it in Rails 4 and Ruby 2, but in light of the large codebase out there in older versions, I decided to use Rails 3.2.13 and Ruby 1.9.3.</p>

<p>It was developed the site using test-Unit, shoulda, Mocha, and fixtures, and RSpec.  The database backend is PostGres, and it is hosted on Heroku. </p>

<p>While I could have used Factory Girl and other more popular TDD gems, I felt it was important to show my familiarity with older resources as there is a large base of old code out there.  (Yes I know how to user RSPec 2, Factory Girl, Launcy, Faker, Capybara etc.) </p>
